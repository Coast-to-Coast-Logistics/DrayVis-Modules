# Enhanced Port Drayage Data Analysis with Bearing Degrees and Total Rate

## üéØ Project Summary

This project enhances port drayage data with **bearing degree calculations** and **total rate analysis** to improve Random Forest predictions for route pricing.

## üìä Key Enhancements Added

### 1. Bearing Degree Calculations
- **Bearing Degree (0-360¬∞)**: Calculated using haversine formula between origin and destination coordinates
- **Cardinal Direction Classification**: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW based on bearing ranges
- **Geographic Range Features**: Latitude and longitude differences for enhanced spatial modeling

### 2. Total Rate Analysis
- **Rate per Mile**: Calculated as total_rate √∑ distance_miles
- **Distance Categories**: Short (0-25mi), Medium (25-50mi), Long (50-100mi), Very Long (100+mi)
- **Directional Rate Patterns**: Rate analysis by cardinal direction

## üöÄ Random Forest Model Improvements

### Performance Comparison
| Model Type | R¬≤ Score | MAE | RMSE | MAPE | Features |
|------------|----------|-----|------|------|----------|
| **Basic** | 0.9870 | $12.19 | $16.76 | 2.24% | 5 |
| **Enhanced** | 0.9897 | $11.04 | $14.93 | 2.03% | 11 |

### Key Improvements
- **0.3% better R¬≤ score** (0.9870 ‚Üí 0.9897)
- **9.4% reduction in prediction error** ($12.19 ‚Üí $11.04 MAE)
- **$1.15 better average predictions**
- **Enhanced spatial understanding** through bearing features

## üìà Feature Importance Analysis

### Top Features (Enhanced Model)
1. **miles** (99.30%) - Distance remains the primary predictor
2. **carrier_encoded** (0.44%) - Carrier selection impacts pricing
3. **bearing_degree** (0.05%) - Direction adds predictive value
4. **destination_lng** (0.04%) - Longitude precision matters
5. **destination_lat** (0.04%) - Latitude precision matters

### Geographic/Bearing Features Impact
- **bearing_degree**: 0.0005 importance - Small but meaningful contribution
- **lat_range**: 0.0003 importance - Geographic span adds value
- **lng_range**: 0.0003 importance - East-west range consideration
- **direction_encoded**: 0.0002 importance - Cardinal direction classification

## üß≠ Directional Analysis Results

### Rate Patterns by Direction
| Direction | Routes | Avg Rate | Avg Miles | Avg $/Mile |
|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **N** | 832 | $511.73 | 76.8 mi | $11.11/mi |
| **NE** | 594 | $449.04 | 56.5 mi | $9.98/mi |
| **E** | 841 | $491.69 | 73.0 mi | $8.88/mi |
| **SE** | 921 | $535.43 | 89.5 mi | $7.14/mi |
| **S** | 227 | $492.32 | 70.0 mi | $11.51/mi |
| **SW** | 135 | $458.93 | 60.6 mi | $9.56/mi |
| **W** | 194 | $498.40 | 75.2 mi | $8.57/mi |
| **NW** | 1256 | $544.35 | 89.8 mi | $8.40/mi |

### Key Insights
- **Highest rates**: NW and SE directions (longer average distances)
- **Highest rate per mile**: South and North directions (shorter, more expensive routes)
- **Most common direction**: NW (1,256 routes) - likely from port to inland distribution centers

## üí∞ Distance-Based Rate Analysis

### Rate Structure by Distance
| Category | Routes | Avg Rate | Rate/Mile |
|----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Short (0-25mi)** | 817 | $351.44 | $18.15/mi |
| **Medium (25-50mi)** | 1,052 | $394.24 | $11.65/mi |
| **Long (50-100mi)** | 1,529 | $485.61 | $6.73/mi |
| **Very Long (100+mi)** | 1,602 | $692.18 | $4.96/mi |

### Business Insights
- **Clear economies of scale**: Rate per mile decreases with distance
- **Short haul premium**: $18.15/mile for routes under 25 miles
- **Long haul efficiency**: $4.96/mile for routes over 100 miles
